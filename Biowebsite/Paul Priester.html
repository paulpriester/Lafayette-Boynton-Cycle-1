  Hello everyone this is my personal website telling you a little about myself. This website looks pretty cool right? I created this bio website myself, one of several of my interest. At the moment I am a beginner at crafting websites but I plan on progressing and challenging myself to make more interactive webpages. Revisit this website in a few months and watch it evolve and become cooler as I advance.

Other interest of mines includes basketball, MMA and videogames. Basketball has always been a passion since I was young. From playing thinking I was Kobe Bryant to watching him drop 50 on any given night. This is something that will always be with me. MMA became an interest because of my hobby karate. I began karate at the age of 8 with my brothers as a summertime activity. My parents thought it was great way to keep us busy. Eventually we all became black belts and fell in love with the sport. So I enjoy MMA for the various techniques put together in the form of competition. Videogames is something I always love. My brothers and I will always compete in all type of games for supremacy. Even now I play as a pastime. I would love to create a videogame one day in the future.
